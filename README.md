This is a game I have created about a dog called Bongo. Bongo is seperated from his owners and is sent far away from them. Strange Abyssal creatures and rips in space have appeared
out of no where, but only the animal kingdom are able to conceptualise them.
Bongo's objective is to return home safely, while navigating the treacherous terrain and creatures lurking in the dark.
